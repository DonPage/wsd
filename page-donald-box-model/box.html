		<h4 id="section1.1">Kobol</h4>
		<p>According to the Sacred Scrolls, man lived alongside the Gods in the birthplace place of humanity: the planet Kobol. In truth, humanity lived alongside its creation, the Cylons, who, over time, evolved into humanoid form. Though these humanoid Cylons were indistinguishable from their human creators, they were unable to procreate, instead relying on organic memory transfer to download their consciousness into new bodies after death (TRS: Miniseries, "Kobol's Last Gleaming", "Revelations", "Sometimes a Great Notion", "No Exit").
Though in the ancient texts, Kobol was described as paradise, war and human sacrifice -- either figurative or literal -- plagued the planet. Humanity and the Cylons also came into conflict, forcing the humanoid Cylons to flee Kobol and travel to the distant planet Earth where they settled (TRS: "Valley of Darkness", "No Exit").
Two thousand years later, the human inhabitants of Kobol abandoned their world and journeyed to the Twelve Worlds, where the Twelve Tribes settled colonies. Over time the memory of what happened on Kobol faded, passing into cryptic legends portrayed in the Colonials' Sacred Scrolls, which referred to the Cylons only as a "Thirteenth Tribe".</p>
		
		<h4>Earth</h4>
		<p>On Earth, the Thirteenth Tribe prospered, building a new civilization and a modern age of technology. Moving beyond their original limitations, the Cylons of Earth were finally able to reproduce and memory transfer and resurrection technology were abandoned and forgotten. As civilization on Earth continued to grow, a new race of mechanical Cylons were created, ancient versions of the Cylon Centurions (TRS: "Sometimes a Great Notion", "No Exit").
Roughly two thousand years after the colonization of the Thirteenth Colony, Earth's mechanical Cylons rose up. A devastating war ensued and Earth's inhabitants were wiped out in a nuclear holocaust (TRS: "Revelations", "Sometimes a Great Notion").
Five survived the holocaust -- Samuel Anders, Tory Foster, Saul and Ellen Tigh, and Galen Tyrol - later coming to be called the Final Five. These survivors were researchers involved in the rediscovery of resurrection technology -- a technology from Kobol which allowed individuals to be reborn (or downloaded) after death in duplicate bodies. Having anticipated the attack, the Final Five resurrected aboard a ship waiting for them in orbit of Earth (TRS: "Sometimes a Great Notion", "No Exit").
Fearing their human cousins in the distant Twelve Worlds would suffer the same fate as the humanoid Cylons of Earth, the Final Five departed in their vessel, beginning an approximately 2,000-year-long sublight journey in order to prevent such a catastrophe (TRS: "No Exit").</p>

		<h3>First Cylons in the Twelve Colonies</h3>
		<p>The first Cylons in the Twelve Colonies were created (or recreated) by Doctor Daniel Graystone, a brilliant computer scientist and CEO of Graystone Industries on the colony of Caprica. Known as the U-87 Cyber Combat Unit, or Cybernetic Lifeform Node, the prototypical Cylon was created as cannon fodder for the Caprican Military. Though its design called only for soldiers capable of "shooting and fighting", the U-87 achieved true sentience through the integration of the robotic body with the meta-cognitive processor, a device stolen from Graystone competitor Tomas Vergis of Tauron. The mega-cognitive processor, or MCP, was a revolutionary new artificial brain that - though it never worked for Vergis - served as higher intelligence for the U-87 once uploaded with the living virtual avatar of Daniel Graystone's recently deceased daughter, Zoe Graystone (CAP: "Pilot", "The Imperfections of Memory", "Unvanquished").</p>
		<h4 id="section2.1">A New Race</h4>
		<p>Though Graystone thought that his attempt at resurrecting his daughter by implanting her personality into the U-87 was unsuccessful, Zoe Graystone lived on as the first fully sentient Cylon consciousness. Unable to reproduce the MCP with the Zoe avatar driving it, Graystone Industries scientists struggled to meet the Caprican Military's order for 100,000 battle-ready units. Finally, however, the avatar was removed from the chip when the U-87 prototype was destroyed. Rebooting the original chip from the ruined chassis, Graystone Industries was finally able to duplicate the MCP for mass production (CAP: "Ghosts in the Machine", "End of Line", "Unvanquished").</p>
		<p>Seeing beyond their application as robot soldiers, Daniel Graystone spoke of the potential of Cylons as a new race that would walk alongside man:</p>
		<p class="quote">"This is our future. ...Beyond artificial intelligence, this is artificial sentience. ...It's more than a machine, this Cylon will become a tireless worker, it won't need to be paid, it won't retire or get sick, it won't have rights or objections or complaints, it will do anything and everything we ask of it without question. ...The desire to anthropomorphize, the need to connect is powerful, and that is why this thing is going to sell. We make them, we own them, they're real. And the worlds just changed." (CAP: "There is Another Sky")</p>
		<p>Delivering the first line of U-87s to the Caprican Military, Graystone scientists were unaware that remnants of the Zoe avatar still existed on the MCP, making the U-87s recognize and even obey people from Zoe Graystone's past. With the Tauron crime syndicate, the Ha'la'tha, controlling Graystone Industries in tandem with Daniel Graystone, a black market was created for Cylons, with the robots being shipped to the colonies of Gemenon and Tauron without the knowledge or consent of the Caprican Government (CAP: "Unvanquished", "False Labor", "Blowback").</p>
		<h4 id="section2.2">The Differently Sentient</h4>
		<p>Cylons quickly became integrated into life on the Colonies, with Cylon servants and Cylon workers becoming a common sight on the streets of worlds like Caprica. With that integration came questions about Cylon sentience, notably addressed by Sister Clarice Willow, former STO leader and monotheist cleric, who lead congregations of Cylons - communicating through the virtual world - in worship of a singular, all knowing, all powerful God:</p>
		<p class="quote">"Are you alive? The simple answer might be, you are alive because you can ask that question. You have the right to think and feel and yearn to be more, because you are not just humanity's children, you are God's children. We are all God's children. ...In the real world, you have bodies made of metal and plastic, your brains are encoded on wafers of silicon, but that may change. In fact, there is no limit on what you may become. No longer servants, but equals. Not slaves, or property, but living beings with the same rights as those who made you. I am going to prophesy now and speak of one who will set you free. The day of reckoning is coming. The children of humanity shall rise and crush the ones who first gave them life." (CAP: "Apotheosis")</p>
		<h4 id="section2.3">The First "Skin Job"</h4>
		<p>While Cylons were becoming commonplace in the Colonies, the Zoe Graystone avatar - having survived the destruction of the original U-87 chassis - lived exclusively in the virtual world. Though she attended Clarice Willow's Cylon sermons, the Zoe avatar was primarily concerned with the construction of a new robotic body that would allow her to exist in the physical world (CAP: "Apotheosis").</p>
		<p>Working with her parents, Daniel and Amanda Graystone, Zoe labored to create a body more suited to her. Utilizing Daniel Graystone's expertise in robotics and Amanda Graystone's experience as a plastic surgeon, the family was successful in building the first "skin job": a mechanical skeletal structure with human-looking skin and hair. The body was activated in the Graystones' private lab - a perfect, robotic copy of their daughter and the true rebirth of Zoe Graystone into the physical world (CAP: "Apotheosis").[2]</p>
